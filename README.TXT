Raytracer from scratch in RUST
 
This is my own implementation of a raytracer in rust.
I am following a book called: The ray tracer challenge: A test-driven guide to your first 3d renderer by Jamis Buck.
This book provides pseudocode and tests to create your own raytracer.
I though this would be a fun way to learn a new programming language :).
This is my first program every in rust, so the code is probably far from optimal.
